 1. Three double quotes
 2. If line break in literal, then line break also appears in string value
 3. If you want to use line breaks to make your source code easier to read, but you don‚Äôt want the line breaks to be part of the string‚Äôs value, write a backslash (\) at the end of those lines
 4. Because multiline string literals use three double quotes instead of just one, you can include a double quote (") inside of a multiline string literal without escaping it. To include the text """ in a multiline string, escape at least one of the quotation marks.

/*4. Substring
 
 1.when you get a substring from a string, you gen an instance of Substring and not String
 2. unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you‚Äôre ready to store the result for a longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of String
 3. Performance optimization: The difference between strings and substrings is that, as a performance optimization, a substring can reuse part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store the original string, or part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store another substring. This performance optimization means you don‚Äôt have to pay the performance cost of copying memory until you modify either the string or substring. As mentioned above, substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage‚Äîbecause they reuse the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used.
